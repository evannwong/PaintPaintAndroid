# PaintPaintAndroid

Title pending

A joint project between Evan Wong and Jason Jiang, the project consists of developing a android paint software that allows users to create and save their drawings.

# Motivation

A great way to put the skills learned in CPSC 233 to use by developing in Java instead of Kotlin, as well as learning to create android applications inside of android studio

# Tech/framework used

Built with [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)  
Built using JRE version 1.8.0  
Built using Gradle Version 6.1.1  
Built using Android Grade Plugin Version 4.0.1 

# How can I use this application?

An APK will be released once the application is nearing the final stages of completion  

In the meantime, you are free to install android studio using the link provided above, and clone this repository and run it. 

# Features to implement
Eraser

# Features that have been implemented
All basic functionalies including variable brush size and a RGB color pallete. Saving has an issue so therefore it still needs debugging
